--  This  package  provides a simplified way of disconnecting the signal
--  handlers when the handler callback depends on the life time  of  not
--  only  the object which emits the signal, but also some other object.
--  The parent package provides  Object_Connect  for  this,  but  it  is
--  limited  to  widget  objects. This package allows to disconnect upon
--  finalization  of  any  Ada object. The package declares a controlled
--  type  Handler_Reference.  This type can be bound to a signal handler
--  ID  as  returned  by  the  Connect  functions.  Upon finalization of
--  Handler_Reference the callback will be disconnected. Note that  that
--  differently  to   strong   reference   counting   disconnection   is
--  non-additive.  That is when several Handler_Reference objects  refer
--  to the same callback, finalization of any of  them  disconnects  the
--  callback.
